# Living off the land Headless bash Network Scanner üèïÔ∏è

## Overview

`lolnetscan` is a simple yet powerful network scanner written in Bash. It allows you to scan hosts for open ports using TCP or UDP protocols. The tool is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it useful for various network scanning tasks.

## Features

- Scan multiple host(s) for open port(s) using the `bash` shell's built-in `/dev/tcp` feature for TCP or `netcat` for UDP protocols without using `ping`.
- Option to discover live hosts without port enumeration using `ping`
- Specify target hosts using comma, dash, or CIDR notation.
- Specify port numbers using comma or dash, and even expand port ranges.

## Usage

To scan for open ports on one or more target hosts, run the `lolnetscan.sh` script with appropriate options:

```bash
./lolnetscan.sh -host <target> [-p <ports>] [-u]
```

Options:
- `-host <target>`: Specify the target host(s) using comma, dash, or CIDR notation.
- `-p <ports>`: Specify the port number(s) using comma or dash.
- `-u`: Use UDP protocol for port scanning (default is TCP).

For example, to scan TCP ports 80 and 443 on hosts `192.168.0.1` and `192.168.0.2`, use:

```bash
./lolnetscan.sh -host 192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2 -p 80,443
```

> Port range separated by dash also supported 

To scan UDP ports 53, 123, and 161 on a range of hosts, use:

```bash
./lolnetscan.sh -host 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.10 -p 53,123,161 -u
```

> CIDR notation also suported Ex: 192.168.0.1/24

## Running Directly from GitHub

You can run the `lolnetscan` script directly from GitHub without downloading or installing it on the target system. Use the following one-liner command:

```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ousbaailyas/lolnetscan/master/lolnetscan) -host <target> [-p <ports>] [-u]
```

## Or

Installing it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ousbaailyas/lolnetscan
chmod +x lolnetscan/lolnetscan
lolnetscan/lolnetscan  -host <target> [-p <ports>] [-u]
```

## Sample Output

Here's an example of the output you may see while running the script:

```bash
[INF] Host 192.168.0.1 is alive
[INF] Open TCP port 192.168.0.1:80
[INF] Closed or filtered UDP port 192.168.0.1:443
```

## Notes

- This tool uses Bash and some standard Linux utilities (`ping`, `nc`, and `timeout` and ``/dev/tcp` feature). Ensure you have them installed and have appropriate permissions to run network scans.
- Always use network scanning responsibly and with permission. Unauthorized scanning of networks you do not own is illegal and unethical.
